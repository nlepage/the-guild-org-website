I recently found myself trying to build an integration
between a frontend framework and a GraphQL client,
and while doing that I thought it would be nice
to have a live demonstration for this integration.

However, not wanting to host a GraphQL server,
I started thinking about a solution relying only on
a static hosting service, such as Github pages.

I could use one of the free GraphQL APIs available out there,
such as the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), but it has no mutations, 
which is a huge limit to what can be demonstrated...

Well, Yoga runs everywhere, right? So why not in a service worker?
Service workers have WHATWG standard objects, [which Yoga understands](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/integrations/z-other-environments),
and [they can respond to HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/fetch_event)!
